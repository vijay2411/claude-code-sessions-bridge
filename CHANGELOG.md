# Changelog

All notable changes to claude-bridge (originally cc-bridge) are documented here. Each release section is
written while the version is in development and finalized when it ships.

Format: [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), semver.

## [Unreleased]

_Add entries here as you work on the next version. Move them under a dated
heading when you tag the release and bump `package.json` + the banner in
`bridge-server.mjs`._

### Changed
- **Project name rename: `cc-bridge` → `claude-bridge`** in all user-visible places (README title, server banners, MCP `serverInfo.name`, hook output messages, Desktop config key `mcpServers["claude-bridge"]`, skill directory `~/.claude/skills/claude-bridge/`, skill `name:` frontmatter, JSON-LD `name`). `install.sh` auto-migrates: removes the legacy `~/.claude/skills/cc-bridge/` dir and the legacy `mcpServers["cc-bridge"]` Desktop key on re-install. Internal runtime paths (`/tmp/cc-bridge-*`, `CC_BRIDGE_*` env vars, `~/.claude/.cc-bridge-version`, `~/.claude/.cc-bridge-manifest`) are intentionally unchanged — they're implementation details and renaming them would break in-flight installs without benefit.
- Bumped to v2.4.0.

### Added
- **One-line installers**:
  - `curl -fsSL https://vijay2411.github.io/claude-bridge/install.sh | bash` — bootstrap script hosted on the Pages site clones the repo to `~/.local/share/claude-bridge` and runs the in-repo `install.sh`.
  - `npx @vijay2411/claude-bridge install` — published as a scoped npm package. The `bin/cli.mjs` wrapper copies package files to the same `~/.local/share/claude-bridge` location before running `install.sh`, so absolute paths written to `~/.claude/settings.json` survive npm cache cleanup. Other subcommands: `start`, `stop`, `restart`, `check`, `uninstall`, `serve`, `help`.
  - Both install paths land in the same directory and produce identical state.
- **`bin/cli.mjs`** — Node CLI dispatcher for the npm package.
- **`site/install.sh`** — bootstrap script served via GitHub Pages.
- Install CTA on the site now shows both `curl` and `npx` commands side by side.
- **GitHub Pages deploy** — site shipped at <https://vijay2411.github.io/claude-bridge/>. `.github/workflows/deploy-pages.yml` deploys `site/` on every push to `main` that touches `site/**`. Canonical, og:url, twitter:image, sitemap, robots all point at the Pages URL.
- **Showcase site at `site/`** — single-page static landing built with the `anti-slop-frontend` skill workflow. Hero animation is a hand-sketched SVG node graph: 5 labeled Claude agents (frontend / backend / research / db / tests) connected with pencil-wobble lines, with message packets traveling along the wires and a live transcript mirroring the conversation. Editorial dark palette (warm-black + bone + acid-yellow + terracotta + dusty teal), JetBrains Mono display + Instrument Serif italic accents, no build step. Local preview: `cd site && python3 -m http.server 5173`.
- **SEO pass on `site/`** — full `<head>` metadata, Open Graph + Twitter Card with 1200x630 `og-image.png`, JSON-LD `SoftwareApplication` block, favicon set (`favicon.ico`, `favicon.svg`, `apple-touch-icon.png`), web app `manifest.json`, `robots.txt`, `sitemap.xml`, semantic HTML audit, skip-link, focus rings, SVG `<title>`/`<desc>`. Lighthouse: SEO/A11y/Best-Practices 100, Performance 91.
- Project-level `CLAUDE.md` at the repo root that `@`-references `DEVELOPER.md`,
  so Claude Code sessions running inside this repo auto-load the maintainer
  guide. New "First-time setup if you're a developer of this repo" section
  in `DEVELOPER.md` explains the convention.
- Explicit "Documentation update checklist" table near the top of
  `DEVELOPER.md` — hard rule that every code change updates at least one
  MD file, with a per-file mapping of when each one applies.

## [2.2.0] - 2026-05-11

### Added
- **Version tracking** — `install.sh` writes `~/.claude/.cc-bridge-version`
  on install and reports installed vs repo version on `--check`.
- **Install manifest** — `~/.claude/.cc-bridge-manifest` records every path
  the installer touched; the uninstaller reads it back so future versions
  can clean up files an older `install.sh` wouldn't know about. Hardcoded
  cleanup still runs as a belt-and-suspenders fallback.
- **`DEVELOPER.md`** — primary maintainer notes: owner's vision, 15
  hard-learned lessons, release checklist, what NOT to do.
- **`tests/` folder** — runnable test suite (`./tests/run-all.sh` or
  `npm test`). Covers tool behaviour, broadcast input validation,
  graceful shutdown SSE close event, hook MCP-check silencing, install.sh
  process management. Add a test here for every new feature.
- **`CHANGELOG.md`** — this file. Update it whenever you work on a version.

### Changed
- Repo renamed from `claude-code-sessions-bridge` → `claude-bridge`. URLs
  and clone instructions updated in `USAGE.md`. Remote `origin` is now
  `git@github.com:vijay2411/claude-bridge.git`.

## [2.1.0] - 2026-05-11

### Added
- **Bridge protocol skill** — installs to `~/.claude/skills/cc-bridge/SKILL.md`
  using Claude Code's native skill infrastructure. Loads on-demand instead
  of permanently bloating every session's context.
- **Process management** — `./install.sh --start | --stop | --restart` and
  PID file at `/tmp/cc-bridge.pid`. Graceful SIGTERM closes SSE connections
  with an `event: close` notification before exiting, preventing connected
  Claude sessions from crashing.
- **Hook MCP-check** — `SessionStart` hook caches `claude mcp list` result
  in `/tmp/cc-bridge-${SESSION_ID}.mcp`. Other hooks read the cache and
  exit silently when the bridge MCP isn't registered, eliminating nag
  spam in pre-install sessions.
- **Tool schema table** in `USAGE.md` documenting required/optional args
  for all 8 MCP tools.
- **"What gets modified" section** in `USAGE.md` listing every file
  install.sh touches.
- **`check_inbox` tool** for hookless clients (Desktop app) to enumerate
  pending questions without polling `get_thread` per session.
- **Auto-targeting `reply`** — `message_id` is optional when exactly one
  pending question exists.

### Changed
- Replaced the legacy ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md append with the skill model.
  Installer automatically cleans up the legacy section.
- Softened README "battle-tested" claim to "used daily across 2–5
  sessions" — more honest first impression.

### Fixed
- **broadcast() crash on bad input** (`Cannot read properties of undefined`).
  Now validates `content` is a string and returns a clean error instead of
  killing the Node process.
- **No error boundary around tool calls** — all `executeTool` invocations
  are wrapped in try/catch. Global `uncaughtException` and
  `unhandledRejection` handlers added as a final safety net.

## [2.0.0] - 2026-05-10

### Added
- Initial public release at
  `github.com:vijay2411/claude-code-sessions-bridge`.
- MCP-over-SSE server (`bridge-server.mjs`) on port 7400 with 8 tools:
  `register`, `list_sessions`, `ask`, `reply`, `get_thread`, `broadcast`,
  `read_scratchpad`, plus the foundations for `check_inbox` (added in 2.1).
- 5 lifecycle hooks (`SessionStart`, `UserPromptSubmit`, `PostToolUse`,
  `Stop`, `SessionEnd`) for Claude Code CLI auto-registration, question
  injection, and cleanup.
- stdio adapter (`bridge-stdio.mjs`) so the Claude Desktop app (macOS)
  can join via stdio MCP transport.
- 30-day in-memory TTL garbage collection for messages, threads,
  sessions, and scratchpads.
- Ghost-session cleanup on `register()` reconnect via `claude_session_id`.
- Pending-ask migration on rename/reconnect (never fail an in-flight ask).
- Automated `install.sh` (CLI + Desktop), `--check`, `--uninstall`.
- README, USAGE.md, BRIDGE.md.
